# UTMR

This is the code repository for my master thesis.
Currently it is a mess, and more information will be added.


### setup
UTMR_main.py is the main event handler. It imports:

* PyQt5
* CV2
* sys (native)
* os (native)
* numpy (native)

and `QT_Gui` which is the file 'built' in QTdesigner. It serves
as the template for the GUI.
