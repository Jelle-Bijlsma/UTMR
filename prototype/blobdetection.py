"""
Thresholding : Convert the source images to several binary images by thresholding the source image with thresholds
    starting at minThreshold. These thresholds are incremented  by thresholdStep until maxThreshold.
    So the first threshold is minThreshold, the second is minThreshold + thresholdStep, the third is minThreshold +
    2 x thresholdStep, and so on.
 
Grouping : In each binary image,  connected white pixels are grouped together.  Letâ€™s call these binary blobs.

Merging  : The centers of the binary blobs in the binary images are computed, and  blobs located
    closer than minDistBetweenBlobs are merged.
    
Center & Radius Calculation :  The centers and radii of the new merged blobs are computed and returned.
